#### Good workflow Properties
- A good structure and workflow allow you to move from one task to another - without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture.

- A good structure is something you can trust, as It should relieve you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything, if you can trust the system you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important (the content, the writing and the ideas)

- A good structure enables your deep work state.

-  Good workflow should be Simple:
	- There is no need to build a complex system and there is no need to reorganize everything that you already have you can start working and developing ideas immediately by taking smart notes.
	- it's not about redoing what you have done before but about changing the way of working from now on.
	- [[workflow simplicity is essential]]
