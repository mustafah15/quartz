#### what is this book about?
This book aims to change the note-taking techniques that were usually taught without much regard for the overall workflow or the big picture.

#### My Takes on the writer's style

- the writer is using some difficult words for me as nonnative English speaker
- mundane -> could be replaced by "usual"

"Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note"


- [[good workflow properties]]
- [[zettelkasten as a workflow]]



### [[HTSN - Everything You Need To Do]]

#### A few things to keep in mind
getting the tools ready shouldn't take more than 5-10 mins, but having the right tools is only part of the equation.
### The Underlying Principles 

- [[HTSN - writing is the only thing that matters]]
- [[workflow simplicity is essential]]
- [[note taking mistakes]]
- [[zettelkasten note categories]]
- [[HTNS - nobody ever starts from scratch]]
- [[HTNS - let the work carry you forward]]

[[HTSN - Steps To Successful Writing]]
### [[Luhmann's ZettelKasten]]
