module depth is a way of thinking about cost versus benefit. the benefit provided by a module is its functionality. the cost of a module(in terms of system complexity) is its interface. a module's interface represents the complexity that the module imposes on the rest of the system: the smaller and simpler the interface, the less complexity it introduces. the best modules are those with the greatest benefit and the least cost.
