### comparing subdomains solution strategy 

- core subdomains have to be implemented in-house they cannot be bought or adopted which would undermine the notion of competitive advantage, as the company's competitors would be able to do the same. it would be unwise to outsource the implementation of a core subdomain as it is a strategic investment and since core subdoamins are expected to change often and continuously, the solution must be maintainable and easy to evolve, thus core subdomains require implementation of the most advanced engineering techniques. 
- Since generic subdomains are hard but already solved problems it's more cost-effective to buy an off-the-shelf product or adopt an open-source solution than invest time and effort into implementing a generic subdomain in-house. 
- supporting subdomains do not require elaborate design patterns or other advanced engineering techniques a rapid application development framework will suffice to implement the business logic without introducing accidental complexities. ![[Screenshot 2024-01-25 at 08.41.01.png]]
