### comparing subdomains volatility 
- core subdomains can change often if a problem can be solved on the first attempt, it's probably not a good competitive advantage competitors will catch up fast. consequently, solutions for core subdomains are emergent. Different implementations have to be tried out, refined, and optimized moreover the work on. core subdomains are never done, companies continuously innovate and evolve core subdomains
- contrary to the core subdomains supporting subdomains do not change often they do not provide any competitive advantage for the company
- despite having existing solutions generic subdomains can change over time the changes can come in the form of security patches bug fixes or entirely new solutions to generic problems.
