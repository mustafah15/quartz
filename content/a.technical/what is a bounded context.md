**The solution for [[inconsistent models|Inconsistent Models]] in domain-driven design is trivial: divide the ubiquitous language into multiple smaller languages, then assign each one to the explicit context in which it can be applied: **its bounded context**

As we Identified two bounded contexts (marketing and sales) the term lead exists in both bounded contexts, each fine-grained ubiquitous language is consistent and follows the domain experts' mental models.
In a sense, terminology conflicts and implicit contexts are an inherent part of any decent-sized business. with the bounded context pattern, the contexts are modeled as an explicit and integral part of the business domain.
