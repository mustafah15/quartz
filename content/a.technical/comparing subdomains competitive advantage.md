### comparing subdomains competitive advantage 
- Only core subdomains provide a competitive advantage to a company, 
- Generic subdomains by definition cannot be a source for any competitive advantage as these are generic solutions the same solution used by the company and its competitors 
- supporting subdomains have low entry barriers and cannot provide a competitive advantage either, usually a company wouldn't mind if its competitors copied its supporting subdomains
