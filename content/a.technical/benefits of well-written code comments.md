- the overall idea behind comments is to capture information that was in the mind of the designer but couldn't be represented in the code. this information ranges from low-level details, such as hardware quirk that motivates a particularly tricky piece of code, to high-level concepts such as the rationale for a class. when other developers come along later to make modifications the comments will allow them to work more quickly and accurately,
- without documentation future, developers will have to rederive guess at the developer's original knowledge this will take additional time and there is a risk of bugs if the new developer misunderstands the original designer's intentions
