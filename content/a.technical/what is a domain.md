### What Is a Domain?
- A domain in the context of the software, it refers to the business or idea that we are modeling.
- Experts in the domain are people who understand the business, not necessarily the software.
- the Key goal of DDD is to build a model that the domain experts understand, and the model is not the software.
	- the model represents our understanding of the domain.
	- the software is an implementation of the model.

Business domain: The business domain define a company's main area of activity, it's the service the company provides to its clients for example. 
	- FedEx provides courier delivery
	- walmart is a retail establishment 
a company can operate in multiple business domains for example amazon, it's also important to note that companies can change their business domains
