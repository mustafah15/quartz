### comparing subdomains complexity 

Different types of subdomains have different levels of complexity when designing software we have to choose tools and techniques that accommodate the complexity of the business requirement therefore identifying subdomain complexity is essential for designing a sound software solution
- Core subdomains are complex they should be as hard for competitors to copy as possible the company's profitability depends on it. that is why strategic companies are looking to solve complex problems as their core subdomains. 
- Generic subdomains are much more complicated compared to the supporting domains there should be a good reason why the company already invested time and effort in solving these problems. these solutions are neither simple nor trivial, consider for example encryption algorithms or authentication mechanisms.
- Supporting subdomain business logic is simple often it does not go beyond validating inputs or converting data from one structure to another.
