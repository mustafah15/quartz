- Reference notes are factual, source-specific notes that provide detailed information about a specific topic. They are usually directly taken from external sources such as books, articles, websites, or research papers. They are the building blocks for your knowledge base and are often used as raw data for creating more refined notes.
- a single long note containing brief citations or references to what caught your attention while consuming a material, it should contain a link to the original source, like the book name and page number and conclusion of what you found on this page, this note should allow you to come back later to it and revisit what caught your attention and make a permanent note out of it.
