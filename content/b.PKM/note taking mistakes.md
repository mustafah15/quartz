- collecting notes only that are related to a specified project and then you have to start all over again with each new project.
- Treating all notes as [[fleeting notes]] and just collecting lots of unprocessed notes inevitably leads to chaos. even small amounts of unclean and unrelated notes around your desk will soon induce the wish to start from scratch. 
- Treating all notes as [[permanent notes]] and keeping a notebook for every single idea you have and storing all of them in one place which leads to the collection of good ideas is delighted by other notes which might be not good at second sight.
- not enough maintenance, as any system needs maintenance your personal knowledge system also needs some, as your notes grow and your needs change you need to do regular maintenance and update to your system, you might not need to implement every single note-taking technique in the beginning which is the right thing to do start as simple as you need then if you find your system grows to add more techniques that keep that added complexity under control that only can happen when you have maintenance work, otherwise your system will be neglected and will not serve its purpose as intended
