(صندوق الملاحظات)(note box) 

The zettelkasten is the method/workflow that [[Niklas Luhmann]] popularised or invented to take notes and publish ideas, papers and books.

This technique and tools turned the son of a brewer into one of the most productive and revered social scientists of the 20th century ([[Niklas Luhmann]]). It describes how he implemented them into his workflow so he could say, "I never force myself to do anything I don't feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else."

and despite his significant output [[Niklas Luhmann]] wrote very little about his zettelkasten while the bits and peices that can be gleaned from interviews and his essay "communicating with note boxes" are valuable and telling, first-hand accounts of Luhmann's practice and reasoning are few.
