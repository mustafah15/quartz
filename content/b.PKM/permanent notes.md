what are permanent notes
these notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place either as [[literature notes]] in the reference system or written as if for print in the [[zettelkasten]]

Why make permanent notes
To integrate what you capture into your knowledge system, you must transform it into something that connects to your existing thoughts and ideasâ€”whether by confirming, expanding, or even challenging it. These links create relationships that weave your ideas into a cohesive knowledge network, this transformation is only done when you make the permanent notes.


in its basic form, a permanent note should have 
- single idea
- link(s) to other notes stored in your zettelkasten
- a title if it's required to create one.

but it also can hold additional information that makes it useful
- a reference to where the idea comes from.
- a record pointing towards where this idea is used in your zettelkasten
- a unique ID or [[folgezettel]]
