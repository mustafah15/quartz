If [[Niklas Luhmann]] Zettelkasten was so great and made him that productive why didn't everyone use it?
 - there was misunderstanding about how Luhmann actually worked, which led to disappointing results, the main misunderstanding stems from an isolated focus on the slip box and neglect of the actual workflow in which it was embedded.
 - almost everything that is published about this system was only in German which was almost exclusively discussed within a small group of devoted sociologists who specialised in Luhmann's theory of social system
 - the most important reason is the very fact it is simple intuitively most people didn't expect much from simple ideas.
