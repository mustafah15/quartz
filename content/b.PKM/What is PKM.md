**Personal Knowledge Management** (or PKM) is how we gather, store and interact with knowledge throughout our lives.

It developed as a consequence of a new type of worker: [[knowledge workers]]. Knowledge workers are people who think for a living. The value they add to the workplace stems from knowledge, experience & intuition that they apply to the challenges at hand.

In an ever-faster changing world, it has become the consensus that the individual worker is himself responsible for his professional growth. Thus, personal knowledge management was born to describe the individual counterpart to knowledge management, the science of how companies organise and share knowledge.

So in short, **PKM is about dealing with all the information flying your way**.
