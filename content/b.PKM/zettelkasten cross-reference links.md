[[Niklas Luhmann]] set four types of cross-references only two of them are relevant for digital zettelkasten 

- the first type of links are those on notes to give you the overview of an idea, these are notes directly referenced from the index, they don't have to be written in one go as links can be added over time
- not relevant for digital zettelkasten - notes that help you to locate other notes in your physical zk and tell you which physical compartment your note lives in.
- again not relevant for digital zk those links that indicate the note to which the current note is a follow-up and those links indicate the note that follows on the current note.
- the most common form of reference is plain note-to-note links, this is linking two related notes regardless of where they are within the slip-box.


these links can help us to find surprising connections and similarities between seemingly unrelated topics.

patterns might not become visible at the beginning but they might start to emerge after multiple note-to-note links.

It's not a coincidence that one of the main features of [[Niklas Luhmann]] theory is the discovery of structural patterns that could be found in very different part of the society 

It's important to understand that the making of these links is not a chore. the search for meaningful connection is a crucial part of the thinking process towards the finished manuscript 

As we are making these connections, we build up the internal structure of the [[zettelkasten]] which is shaped by our thinking while this builds up externally and indepenwdently of our limited memory it will in return shape our thinking as well help us to think more structured way
