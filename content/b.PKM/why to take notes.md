Note-taking lets you quickly get ideas out of your head and onto the page, forcing previously vague thoughts to engage with the language needed to convert them into coherent and concrete ideas. 

Notetaking provides a structured framework for organising information. Well-organized notes enable learners to review content efficiently, locate specific details, and grasp the overall flow of information.
