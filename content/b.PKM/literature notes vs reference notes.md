Different people use those two terms differently. Some use them interchangeably. Others refer to reference notes as the notes containing all rough notes from a source and literature notes as notes containing a _single_ quote/idea from a _single_ source, and then create their permanent notes collecting one or more literature notes from one or more sources together.
