If the ideas captured in the fleeting note are connected with others inside your zettelkasten, they must be rewritten as [[permanent notes]]. 
the permanent note has a title and other metadata for easy indexing and retrieval and it has links to other ideas already stored in your zettelkasten the fleeting note has none of these attributes
